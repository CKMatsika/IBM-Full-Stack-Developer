Simple Interest Calculator
Project Overview
This repository hosts a simple script to calculate Simple Interest based on the given principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years. The project was created as part of a gradual migration process from Subversion (SVN) to Git, and serves as the first step in hosting the micro-finance startup's codebase on GitHub.

The mission of this micro-finance startup is to empower and provide opportunities for low-income individuals by offering micro-financing solutions. This simple interest calculator is a small part of the financial tools the company is developing to help users understand basic financial concepts.

Features
Simple Interest Calculation:
Input:
p: Principal amount
t: Time period (in years)
r: Annual rate of interest (in decimal form, i.e. 5% = 0.05)

This script takes the values for the principal, time, and rate of interest as inputs and calculates the simple interest using the formula:

css
Simple Interest = Principal * Time * Rate
