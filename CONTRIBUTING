Thank you for considering contributing to our project! We welcome all kinds of contributions, whether it's fixing bugs, improving documentation, or adding new features. Please read through the following guidelines to ensure your contribution is meaningful and in line with our standards.

How to Contribute
1. Fork the Repository
Before making any changes, please fork the repository to your GitHub account. This allows you to freely experiment with your changes without affecting the original project.

2. Clone Your Fork
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-interest-calculator.git
3. Create a Branch
When youâ€™re ready to make changes, create a new branch for your feature or fix:

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b feature-name
This step ensures that your work is isolated from the main project.

4. Make Changes
Modify the code to fix bugs, add features, or improve documentation. Please follow the existing code style and conventions to keep the codebase consistent.

5. Commit Your Changes
Once your changes are complete, commit them with a meaningful message that explains the purpose of the changes:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Add feature/fix bug: [brief description of the changes]"
6. Push to Your Fork
Push the changes from your local branch to your fork on GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push origin feature-name
7. Create a Pull Request
Once your changes are pushed to GitHub, go to the original repository and create a pull request. Be sure to explain the purpose of your changes and why they should be merged into the project.

8. Wait for Review
Your pull request will be reviewed by a project maintainer. We may ask for clarifications or changes, so please be ready to respond. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the project.

Contribution Guidelines
Bug Fixes: Ensure that your changes address the bug without introducing new issues. If possible, write tests that reproduce the bug and verify the fix.
